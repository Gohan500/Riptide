## Fixes

- Fixed <code><xref:Riptide.Utils.Converter.SetBits(System.UInt64,System.Int32,System.UInt64[],System.Int32)></code> not overwriting bits properly in some cases, which could cause all sorts of problems, including incorrect disconnections due to "poor connection" quality ([#123](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide/issues/123)).
